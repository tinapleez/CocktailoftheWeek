Okay ... sigh ... after MUCH trial and tribulation, I have become the go-to expert on changing the color of the Action Bar/App Bar background -and- Text/Title color, and even the mystical Menu/Overflow icon color. Whew, it was stupid hard to get some clarification - when it's actually really frickin easy.

So basically, copy and modify my styles.xml. Update your manifest to use your custom theme. (Look at my manifest for an example.)

Cheers!
